# DEFECTS — the compiler defects that are still open

Every item is a **measured** failure of the compiler on a program — a crash, a
wrong answer at exit 0, a silence where a message is owed — carrying its
reproducer, its cause where known, and what is owed. **Only open defects live
here**: a repaired one is ticked, gains a *The repair* section with the
measurements that prove it, and moves to `docs/records/done/`. A repair is owed
at the class and not at the witness, with a `tests/golden/fixedbugs/` case per
shape.

**The shape** is `.claude/rules/records.md` § The lists, and § A live list is a
preamble, a count and its items is why this preamble is fifteen lines. **The
next number is READ, never remembered** — `records/numbering` takes one above
the highest issued across this file and `docs/records/done/`. Who issued which
number since 2026-09-08, and why 014 exists twice, is
`docs/records/log/2026-09-16-2200-the-defect-register-leaves-the-list.md`.

**OPEN: 3**

- [ ] **077 — a handle given back after C has handed its address out again is `check` 0 and `run` 0, and the release lands on the new handle** | the live set keys on the address, so a stale handle that equals a live one is accepted as the live one, and the one correct release that follows is the call that aborts | `runtime/parts/alloc.c:436` · `spec § 13`

    **Origin:** panel 175's spec-warden, 2026-09-23 (its F1), reproduced by the
    coordinator the same day before filing.

    **The reproducer**, over `r1.h`'s `box_open`/`box_close` (both `noinline`,
    `malloc` and `free`):

        extern "r1.h"
            record Box tag box
            function box_open() -> Box acquires box_close
            function box_close(b: Box consumes)

        function main()
            b = box_open()
            box_close(b: b)
            c = box_open()
            print("same address: ", b == c)
            box_close(b: b)
            print("after the second give-back of b")

    `check` 0; `run` 0, zero bytes of stderr, three of three on Darwin arm64,
    printing `same address: true`. The seat measured five of five at `-O0` and
    `-O2`, and with `box_close(b: c)` added at the end the program aborts at that
    call, the one correct release in it (134, 396 bytes, three of three).

    **That reproducer depends on the allocator, and this one does not** —
    panel 175's completeness critic, 2026-09-23: two binaries from
    byte-identical C, differing only in their UUID and code signature, read 0
    and 134, because the signature decides whether libmalloc hands the freed
    block straight back. The critic's `u1_static.hero`, over a C `f_open` that
    returns one static cell every time and an `f_close` that frees nothing,
    is the one to repair against: `f_open`, `f_close(x: a)`, `b = f_open()`,
    `print(a == b)`, `f_close(x: a)` reads `true` and exits 0 with zero bytes,
    three of three, rerun by the coordinator.

    **Why it is a defect.** Spec § 13 says *the live handles are a set, so
    giving one back twice aborts on its own*, and here a handle given back twice
    does not. `hero_handle_consumed` compares the address (`alloc.c:436`) and the
    comment at `:411-414` already says the set holds one entry per address. What
    it does not say is that the second release of a stale handle then frees a
    live one in silence.

    **Linux, run by the coordinator:** `run` 0, three of three, `same address:
    true`, on arm64 and x86-64 alike. **Under `--sanitize` it is caught**, 134,
    *given back that were never taken*, on both, and that is the sanitizer
    HIDING the defect rather than finding it: ASan's quarantine does not hand a
    freed address straight back, so `c` gets a different one and the stale `b`
    is a stray. **Unrun:** Windows.

    **Added 2026-09-24, with defect 088's correction:** the stale `b` is the
    copy design.md Part 8 wart 20 says outlives a consuming call, and what this
    defect adds to the wart's class is the reuse — the copy is not merely
    dangling, it names a live handle, so no check on the address alone can tell
    them apart. The spec sentence `a747e5a2` landed, *unless C has since reused
    its address*, states that limit; §1.12 is why it cannot be the answer.

- [ ] **088 — a handle handed to a call after the call that ended its life is `check` 0 and `run` 0, and C is handed freed memory** | § 13 says a `consumes` call ends the value's life, and nothing reads the value as dead afterwards: the checker does not, and the live set is asked only by a consuming call | `spec § 13` · `selfhost/emit/handle_traffic.hero` · `runtime/parts/alloc.c`

    **Origin:** panel 176's completeness critic, 2026-09-23 (its § 7), which
    searched this file for `use.after`, `survive` and `after consum` and found
    nothing. Reproduced by the coordinator on 2026-09-24 before filing, from the
    critic's own files copied out of its directory.

    **The reproducer**, over a three-function cJSON in miniature (`CreateObject`,
    `AddItemToObject` that links `item` under `object`, `Delete` that frees a
    node and its children), declared with `acquires cJSON_Delete` on the
    creator, `item: Json consumes` on the adder and `item: Json consumes` on
    `Delete`:

        b = cJSON_CreateObject()
        cJSON_Delete(item: b)
        c = cJSON_CreateObject()
        _ = cJSON_AddItemToObject(object: b, string: "c".cstr(), item: c)
        print("wrote into a deleted object")

    `check` 0; **run 0, three of three, on Darwin arm64, Linux x86-64 and Linux
    arm64**, printing its line after C wrote into freed memory; with
    `--sanitize`, `heap-use-after-free` on all three (134 on Darwin, 1 on
    Linux). Windows unrun: the box was off.

    **The shapes beside it, and why they are not this defect.** The same dead
    handle given to a CONSUMING parameter is stopped before C on all three
    legs, 134 with the runtime's *given back that were never taken* — a true
    line, since the address left the set at the first release. And through a
    helper, `finish(@b)` releasing it and the caller reusing `b` as `item`, the
    same 134. So the silence is exactly where the handle reaches a parameter
    that does not consume: no check reads it there.

    **Why it is a defect.** design.md §1.12: a Heroes program must not corrupt
    memory, and this one does at exit 0 with no C in it but the library's own.
    It belongs with defect 077, the other shape where the live set cannot tell
    a handle that is over from one that is not, which is why panel 177 takes
    both.

    **Corrected 2026-09-24, before panel 177 sat: this shape is inside a class
    design.md already states, and the filing missed it.** Part 8 wart 20 — *one
    copy of a value holding a `ptr` can free what every other copy holds, at
    exit 0* — says the half `consumes` does not reach is *a copy made BEFORE
    the call still holds the freed address*, and that the class is the affine
    handle, which Part 6's borrow-checker row refuses on COST since 2026-09-13.
    `b` above is that copy. The critic searched this file and the coordinator
    searched nothing else; `grep -n "wart 20\|affine" docs/design/design.md`
    finds it, and panel 153 had declined to file a shape of the same class on
    that ground and said so. **It stays filed, and this is why**: the wart
    admits the class *only while the cheapest guard is being built rather than
    argued about*, and the live set that panel 150 added since gives this
    shape a guard the wart could not name — the dead handle is not in the set
    when it reaches a parameter that does not consume. Whether that guard is
    the cheapest, and what it does to a `borrows` handle that was never in the
    set, is panel 177's question. The author can disagree and close it on the
    wart, as panel 153 put it.

- [ ] **096 — inside an `extern` group, a remark followed by a blank line before the next member makes `fmt` refuse the file** | the group printer never emits the blank line for a continuing member, so the remark becomes the next member's doc, the self-check sees a different tree and `fmt` exits 2 on a program `check` accepts | `selfhost/print/fmt.hero` (the group's member walk, the `continues` branch)

    **Origin:** the skeptic seat over defect 095's repair, 2026-09-25, attacking
    the repair at the shapes beside it; measured on the seed compiler of
    `0a8fd346` and on the repaired one alike, so it is older than both.

    **The reproducer.** A group whose first member is followed by a remark, a
    blank line, and `record Ob tag ob`:

        extern "x.h"
            function ob_put(o: Ob consumes)
            # a remark about what follows

            record Ob tag ob

    `check` exit 0; `fmt` exit 2, *`fmt` changed the TREE … a DIFFERENT
    PROGRAM*, and the file is not touched. With no line-broken signature
    anywhere, so it is not 095's shape: the blank line is what is lost.

    **Why it is a defect.** A correct program is refused by a tool that must
    be idempotent on every program the parser accepts (design.md §4.15); the
    exit-2 guard stops the silent form, which would attach the remark to the
    record as its doc. The repair keeps the blank line between a remark and
    the member it does not document, inside a group as outside one.
