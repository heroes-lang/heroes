# DEFECTS — the compiler defects that are still open

Every item is a **measured** failure of the compiler on a program — a crash, a
wrong answer at exit 0, a silence where a message is owed — carrying its
reproducer, its cause where known, and what is owed. **Only open defects live
here**: a repaired one is ticked, gains a *The repair* section with the
measurements that prove it, and moves to `docs/records/done/`. A repair is owed
at the class and not at the witness, with a `tests/golden/fixedbugs/` case per
shape.

**The shape** is `.claude/rules/records.md` § The lists, and § A live list is a
preamble, a count and its items is why this preamble is fifteen lines. **The
next number is READ, never remembered** — `records/numbering` takes one above
the highest issued across this file and `docs/records/done/`. Who issued which
number since 2026-09-08, and why 014 exists twice, is
`docs/records/log/2026-09-16-2200-the-defect-register-leaves-the-list.md`.

**OPEN: 7**

- [ ] **130 — after a `match` whose arm fails to parse, the next statement is skipped whole, and every mistake in it goes unreported** | in `function main()`, three bound matches `a = match n`, `b = match n`, `c = match n`, each with the arms `+ => 10` and `_ => 20`, report lines 4 and 10 and never line 7; two statement matches `match n` over `+ => print(1)` report only the first; and a plain statement after one such match, `y = 3 )` over `z = 4 )`, reports the second line and not the first, where the same two lines after no `match` report both | `selfhost/grammar_expr.hero` (`match_expr`) · the enclosing statement's recovery

    **Origin:** lane 123's agent, 2026-09-28, beside defect 124, on the
    trunk's compiler at `aee8b01e` (reproducers `shapes/y01_three_bad.hero`
    and `shapes/y02_stmt_bad.hero` in `/Users/joseph/Temp/heroes-lane-123-scratch/`);
    reproduced by the coordinator on the trunk's compiler at `d0f24496` at
    18:47, who widened it from a second `match` to any statement with
    `z2_two_plain_errors.hero`, beside the control `z4_no_match.hero`
    (`/Users/joseph/Temp/heroes-recovery-2026-09-26/defect130/`, 2026-09-28).
    The cause is unrun and inferred by the finder from the reading:
    `match_expr` skips the failed arm's line, and the enclosing statement's
    own recovery then drops one more line.

    **Why it is a defect.** The program is refused, so nothing runs wrong,
    but a mistake is present and unreported: a silence where a message is
    owed. design.md §4.17 asks that a model fix a program in one turn; a
    mistake hidden behind another costs a second one, and a third where two
    are hidden in a row.

    **Carried to the next milestone**, by the author's instruction of
    2026-09-28 16:40 (`docs/records/log/2026-09-28-1640-m-agreed-retention-closes-over-the-defects-found-after-its-last-eight.md`):
    found after the eight M-agreed-retention repairs before its tag, and
    not repaired in it.

    **Widened 2026-09-28 at 23:00 by the coordinator, on the trunk's compiler
    at `79aeeffa`: the class is every statement that ends with its own block,
    and the cause is now read, not inferred.** The reproducers were rebuilt
    from this entry's text, the directory above being gone by 22:55
    (`/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/d130/`, 2026-09-28),
    and they print what the entry says. `grammar_expr.finish` skips the rest
    of the line of any statement that reported a diagnostic, and a statement
    whose last part is a block has already consumed its own dedent, so the
    line it skips is the next statement's, and `balanced_block` then takes
    that statement's block. The skip is keyed on a diagnostic anywhere inside
    the statement, so the arm is one witness of many: an error in the body of
    a `for` (`w1`), an `if` (`w2`), a `while` (`w3`), an `else` (`w4`), a
    bound `if` (`w5`) or an arm's block (`w7`) hides the statement after it,
    and two nested blocks hide two (`w6`, lines 6 and 7). A declaration's
    body does not (`w9`): `cursor.recover_to_next_decl` asks whether the
    cursor already stands at a fresh line, which `finish` never asks.

    **Corrected 2026-09-28 at 23:17**: the directories were removed by the
    author, who took them for old lanes, and restored from the trash the
    same evening, so the paths above resolve again; the copies in the
    scratchpad are what the lanes read.

    **Widened 2026-09-29 by lane 130's agent, reported beside its repair and
    assigned here by the coordinator**: a statement that failed drops the
    over-indented block hanging below it silently, the mistakes inside it
    too, where after a statement that did not fail the same block is
    `unexpected_block` (`o01_failed_then_orphan.hero` against
    `o02`, in
    `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/lane-130/shapes/`, 2026-09-29).

    **Widened again 2026-09-29 by lane 130's agent at its second round, and
    assigned by the coordinator**: under an arm written inline, `0 => print(1)`
    over a deeper `print(99)` compiled and ran and printed 1, the deeper line
    thrown away at exit 0, a wrong answer and not only a silence (repaired
    in lane 130, `47849cc9`); and a misspelled keyword at a top-level head,
    `recrod Point` over its fields, drops its whole block silently (given to
    lane 133, whose files it is in; reproducers in
    `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/lane-130/`, 2026-09-29).

    **Widened 2026-09-29 by lane 133's agent**: on the compilers of
    `a6eab736` and `7c0cb024` the parser HUNG, forever, on a line headed by a
    refused word after an `if`, `while` or `for` block (`elif`, or `let`
    after an `if`); lane 130's merge `0ba7b084` ended it, measured at exit 1,
    and a case per shape is owed (`hang/o.hero`, `y3`, `y4`, `y8`, `r`, `s`);
    and a bodiless or empty declaration above a line opened by a guidance
    word (`class`, `let`, `€`) is never told, before or after `--apply`
    (`next/fbody_class.hero`); both in
    `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/lane-133/`, 2026-09-29.

    **Widened 2026-09-29 by lanes 132 and 133 at their last rounds**: the
    fields and cases inside a record's or variant's braces are skipped, so
    their own mistakes wait for the braces to go; a nested `if x == 1 {`
    inside a braced body loses its first line (`r2/brace/nested.hero` in
    `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/lane-133/`, 2026-09-29); and
    `for` over a same-margin `print(1) )` hides the `)`, where `if` alone over
    the same line does not name its missing body (lane 132's report).

    **Widened 2026-09-29 by lane X2's agent**: `extern` alone over
    `"m.h" )` never reports the `)` in the normal arm, the second reading
    holding it (`s4/d13` in `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/lane-x2/`, 2026-09-29).

    **Widened 2026-09-29 by lanes X1 and Y at their reports**: a braced record,
    variant or `extern` group still goes whole, so a mistake inside is never
    reported (`f1*`); a block under a refused line that cannot open one
    (`let x = 5`, `import geom`) is read silently where it is a mistake of its
    own (`f7*`); a block of declarations under a refused head goes whole
    (`f9*`), all in `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/lane-x1/findings/`, 2026-09-29; a
    missing body is not told when the line below fails the joined head, `if`
    over `print(1 +)` (`i3d/c1.hero`, `c2`, `c3`, `i3b/a13.hero`); and an
    unexpected block is dropped whole with its mistakes unsaid, `x = 1` over a
    deeper `print(1) )`, where with `x = 0X10 +` above it the certain fix is
    not a subset (`i4/e8.hero`, `e12.hero`), both in
    `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/lane-y/`, 2026-09-29.

    **Batch gate 2026-09-30 00:07** (`53a5e0a9`, lanes X3 and X4 beside the trunk's
    129 to 133, X1, X2 and Y): the full net, every suite at 0 failed. The shapes
    still open are the next batch lane's items, found beside the repairs, and
    this item stays open until they are repaired and a batch gate reads them.

    **2026-09-30, lane recovery-b1, a member's line ends after its member**
    (lane X4's finding n1, `dark grey` compiled as two cases): repaired at
    `f17bbe90`, gated by its cases and the compiler's own tests; the net is
    owed at the batch's close.

    **2026-09-30, lane recovery-b1, a case's fields in braces are read as its
    fields** (lane X4's finding n2): repaired at `5cdc7288`, gated by its
    cases and the compiler's own tests; the net is owed at the batch's close.

    **2026-09-30, lane recovery-b1, a refused literal is read as the literal it
    stands for at any depth** (lane X4's finding n4): repaired at `f4e991da`,
    gated by its cases and the compiler's own tests; the net is owed at the
    batch's close.

    **2026-09-30, lane recovery-b1, an orphan block that goes on with the line
    above is named once and read** (lane X4's report, the word-then-value
    rule): repaired at `2fd79070`, gated by its cases and the compiler's own
    tests; the net is owed at the batch's close.

    **Batch gate 2026-09-30 01:48** (`1fc77e31`, lane recovery-b1, five
    repairs): the full net, 3852 passed and 0 failed over 26 suites, the
    compiler's own 903 and the net's own 184; then the compiler's 903 and 19
    suites at 0 failed on Linux x86-64, Linux arm64 and the Windows box, whose
    `run` read 160 and 45 with its C: drive at 99% and 205 and 0 re-run alone
    with 16 GB freed. The shapes still open are lane recovery-b2's items.

    **2026-09-30, lane recovery-b2, a declaration opening its line at column 0
    names the brackets a mistake left open** (lane recovery-b1's report, U2):
    repaired at `41807577`, gated by its cases and the compiler's own tests;
    the net is owed at the batch's close.

    **2026-09-30, lane recovery-b2, an orphan under a whole arm that holds its
    own mistake** (lane X4's n3, measured closed by lane recovery-b1): read
    closed on this tree, and its case added at `04b51f08`; lane X3's 6a reads
    closed and had its case. The net is owed at the batch's close.

    **Batch gate 2026-09-30 04:45** (`e5cc73eb`, lane recovery-b2, five
    repairs and a verification case): the full net, 3873 passed and 0 failed
    over 26 suites, the compiler's own 911 and the net's own 184, `corpus` red
    once in the parallel pass on defect 134's false `cannot publish` and 55
    and 0 alone; the census of 1358 files moved the six new cases and nothing
    else. The shapes still open are the next batch's items.

    **2026-09-30, lane recovery-b3, past a closer of another kind the parser
    resumes where the lexer closed the bracket, and an extern group whose
    header failed has its signatures read** (the recovery instrument's
    `wrong-closer`, `single-quotes` and `string-open` as first mistakes):
    repaired at `52b2d378`, gated by its cases and the compiler's own tests;
    the net is owed at the batch's close.

- [ ] **131 — a block head whose line failed reports its missing body as a second mistake** | `if n > )` over an indented `print(1)` costs `expected_expression` and then `missing_body` at the same column; so do `else if`, `while` and `for` heads (`missing_body`) and `match )` (`missing_match_arms`); and `if n >` over a deeper line, joined by `continuation_outside_brackets`, is followed by `missing_body` at the next statement | `selfhost/grammar_expr.hero` (the body checks after a block head, `match_expr`'s arms check) · `cursor.at_reported_error`

    **Origin:** the coordinator, 2026-09-28 at 22:58, attacking the head of
    the blocks beside defect 130 on the trunk's compiler at `79aeeffa`
    (`w8_cond_error.hero` and `v1` to `v6` in
    `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/d130/`, 2026-09-28).
    The cause is read and unrun: the guard before `missing_body` and
    `missing_match_arms` is `cursor.at_reported_error`, which asks whether the
    current TOKEN is an `error` token, not whether the head already reported;
    the failed head leaves the cursor on the `)` it could not read.
    `if (n > )` costs one diagnostic (`v6`), because the parenthesis
    recovery consumes the line.

    **Why it is a defect.** design.md §4.17: one mistake, one message. The
    second names a body that is there, one level down, as missing, so a
    model that reads it as a second mistake repairs a block that was right.

    **Widened 2026-09-29 by lane 130's agent, reported beside its repair and
    assigned here by the coordinator**: a `for` with nothing after it costs
    `for_missing_in` and `expected_expression` at the same column
    (`o03_bare_for.hero`), and a body indented with a tab costs
    `tab_in_indentation` and then `missing_body` on the same line, for a
    body that is there (`l06_tab_body.hero`), both in
    `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/lane-130/shapes/`, 2026-09-29.

    **Widened again 2026-09-29 by lane 130's agent at its second round**:
    `record Point )` and `variant Token )` over their bodies are named
    `empty_record` and `empty_variant`, which says the fields are missing
    while they are there (`shapes3/f37`, `f38` in
    `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/lane-130/`, 2026-09-29); given to lane 133.

    **Widened again 2026-09-29 by the `fixes` suite lane 129 landed, at the
    coordinator's gate of lane 130's second round (`3ecb7ac9`)**: `for >`
    gets `for_missing_in` with the `certain` fix *use `while`*, and
    `--apply` writes `while >`, which is no loop and costs
    `expected_expression` twice on its one line. Measured on the compiler
    of `a6eab736` as well, so it was there before tonight; a `certain` fix
    that does not repair, and one mistake with two messages. Sent back to
    lane 130.

    **Widened 2026-09-29 by lane 133's agent**: `test`, `function` and
    `constant` heads with junk over a body that is there still name it
    missing, `missing_body` found `)` (`a/fjunk.hero`, `cjunk`, `tjunk`);
    `extern "m.h" )` costs two messages; `fn main() {` costs
    `expected_declaration` again at its `}`; and `empty_variant`'s caret
    stands on the next line's first token where `empty_record` points at its
    own head; all in `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/lane-133/`, 2026-09-29.

    **Widened 2026-09-29 by lanes 132 and 133 at their last rounds**: a block
    under a line headed by a refused word is named `unexpected_block`
    beside the word's own report, for a block that is its body
    (`stray_elif.hero`, `const_nested_deeper.hero` in
    `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/lane-132/findings/`, 2026-09-29; `fn` or `struct`
    nested in a body, `r2/matrix/fn__body_decl.hero` in
    `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/lane-133/`, 2026-09-29); `n: 2 @ 3` costs
    two messages at one token; an arm at its `match`'s own margin costs
    `missing_match_arms` and `expected_end_of_line`; `0` over `=> 5` costs
    two; an opening brace on the line below its head, Allman's style, costs
    three (`r2/brace/allman.hero`); and `parse/records.hero` quotes a head
    across a joined line break in the control arm
    (`record_head_quoted_across_a_join.hero`), all reproduced in the two
    lanes' scratch directories named here.

    **Widened 2026-09-29 by lane X2's agent** (reproducers in
    `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/lane-x2/`, 2026-09-29): a `:` in mid-line,
    `if n > 0: print(1)` or `record P: i64`, is taken for the Python habit
    and its `certain` fix writes a program still refused, the line costing
    two messages (`s6/f01`, `f02`, `f03`); `n: {2: i64}` costs
    `expected_type` twice at one token (`s1/a09`); one missing `]` costs
    `unclosed_bracket` and `expected_array_close` (`s1/a21`); an arm at a
    shallower margin after a dedent, and a `=>` line past the arms' dedent,
    cost two (`s2/b09`, `s3/c20`); junk before a broken arm's line end still
    reports `expected_pattern` at the `=>` (`s3/c19`); and a `=>` alone at a
    line's end over the next arm costs two (`s3/c14`, `c21`).

    **Widened 2026-09-29 by lanes X1 and Y at their reports**: `match x {` arms
    and `0 => {` bodies in braces are misread (`f2*`); mixed style, braces
    outside and indentation inside, names each inner body missing (`f3*`); in
    `} x` the `x` goes unsaid (`f4*`); `do {` ... `} while (c)` costs a second
    `missing_body` (`f5*`); `for`'s certain *use `while`* before `(` or `{`
    writes a program with new parse errors (`f6*`); `let x = if c` over a
    body, then `else`, refuses the `else` (`f8*`); an Allman record's caret
    points at the next line's `{` (`f12*`), all in
    `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/lane-x1/findings/`, 2026-09-29; and `k = match n` over a
    same-margin `0 => 1` costs `expected_end_of_line` at the `=>`
    (`i3/match_n_arm_same.hero`, `i3c/b8.hero` in `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/lane-y/`, 2026-09-29).

    and 0 alone; the census of 1358 files moved the six new cases and nothing
    else. The shapes still open are the next batch's items.

    **2026-09-30, lane recovery-b4, a sigil before a name is one message at
    its `@`, and the line is read as the statement it is with the sigil gone**
    (the recovery instrument's `at-prefix`): repaired at `4441148b`, gated by
    its cases and the compiler's own tests; the net is owed at the batch's
    close.

    **2026-09-30, lane recovery-b4, a head inside a bracket left open above
    it names no missing body, and an `else` there is its `if`'s** (panel
    183's critic, the regression of `52b2d378`): repaired at `3a93d155`,
    gated by its cases and the compiler's own tests; the net is owed at the
    batch's close.

- [ ] **132 — a join into a line that holds a `match` arm's `=>` costs the break a second diagnostic** | inside `match n`, `0 => 5 -` over `1 => 10`, and `0 => 5` over `| 1 => 10`, each draw `continuation_outside_brackets` at the break and then the parser's `expected_end_of_line` at the next arm's `=>`, since the joined line, `0 => 5 - 1 => 10` or `0 => 5 | 1 => 10`, holds two arms | `selfhost/open_line.hero` (the join handed to the parser) · `selfhost/grammar_expr.hero` (`finish`, `match_expr`)

    **Origin:** lane 129's agent, 2026-09-29, beside defect 129 (its finding 2,
    `cascade_next_arms_pattern.hero`, copied to
    `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/d132/`, 2026-09-29);
    reproduced by the coordinator on the trunk's compiler at `7d3cd33b`: two
    breaks, four diagnostics, and on the trunk both joins `certain`, writing
    programs that do not parse (defect 129's class, which lane 129 repairs; the
    second diagnostic stays after that repair, by the lane's own report).

    **The shape, whole, since the file above lives in a session's scratchpad:**
    a function `return match n` whose arms are `0 => 5 -` / `1 => 10` /
    `_ => 20`, and one whose arms are `0 => 5` / `| 1 => 10` / `_ => 20`.

    **Why it is a defect.** Panel 181 item 2: one diagnostic per break, the
    parser handed the line the author broke. Here the line it is handed holds
    the next arm's `=>`, which no join can make part of an arm's body, so the
    parser's refusal is the break's debris and not a second mistake.

    **Widened 2026-09-29 by lane 130's agent, assigned here by the
    coordinator**: an arm with nothing after its `=>`, over the next arm at
    the same margin, is joined by the lexer and the parser then refuses the
    joined `=>`, two messages for one mistake (`o05_empty_arm.hero` and
    `s12`, in
    `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/lane-130/shapes/`, 2026-09-29).

    **Widened again 2026-09-29 by lane 130's agent at its second round**: the
    lexer joins a line into a block head and the parser reports the join's
    debris, `for` alone over a deeper `print(1)` costing
    `continuation_outside_brackets` and `for_missing_in` (`bf.hero`),
    `record`, `variant` and `constant` alone at a line's end (`shapes2/f18`,
    `f19`, `f14`), and `function` alone over a tab-indented body
    (`shapes3/t19`), all in
    `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/lane-130/`, 2026-09-29.

    **Widened 2026-09-29 by lane 133's agent**: the lexer does not take a
    refused word as the start of a fresh line, so such a line joins an open
    line above it and the same mistake takes another code once the swap is
    applied (`next/ctype_then_const.hero`, `field_then_struct.hero`,
    `use_then_import.hero`, `more/open_line_fn2.hero` in
    `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/lane-133/`, 2026-09-29).

    **Widened 2026-09-29 by lane 133 at its last round**: `include <stdio.h>`
    leaves its line open at the `>`, so the next line costs
    `continuation_outside_brackets` beside `reserved_word` (the case it was
    cut from is `fixedbugs-133-a-swap-certain-only-where-its-word-is-right`).

    **Widened 2026-09-29 by lane X2's agent**: a join into a `match` whose arm
    has a bad pattern costs `missing_match_arms` and `expected_pattern` at
    one token in the normal arm (`s2/b13` in
    `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/lane-x2/`, 2026-09-29).

    **Batch gate 2026-09-30 00:07** (`53a5e0a9`, lanes X3 and X4 beside the trunk's
    129 to 133, X1, X2 and Y): the full net, every suite at 0 failed. The shapes
    still open are the next batch lane's items, found beside the repairs, and
    this item stays open until they are repaired and a batch gate reads them.

    **2026-09-30, lane recovery-b4, a `\` at a line's end is one message, and
    the line it asks for is joined and read** (the recovery instrument's
    `backslash`): repaired at `81348c99`, gated by its cases and the
    compiler's own tests; the net is owed at the batch's close.

    **2026-09-30, lane recovery-b4, a `,` after every member is one message
    for its declaration, and the line ends at it** (the recovery instrument's
    `field-commas`): repaired at `68e46a13`, gated by its cases and the
    compiler's own tests; the net is owed at the batch's close.

- [ ] **133 — after a declaration head the lexer refuses as a foreign word with a certain swap, the declaration's own mistakes are reported only once the swap is applied** | `const MAX = 5` costs `reserved_word` alone, and `check --apply` writes `constant MAX = 5`, which then costs `expected_constant_type`; `const MAX: i64 = 5` then costs `missing_body`, `fn main() {` then `missing_body`, `struct Point {` then `empty_record`: two turns for one habit | `selfhost/scan.hero` (the foreign word emitted as an `error` token) · `selfhost/keywords.hero` (`foreign_word`) · `selfhost/parse/decl.hero` · `cursor.recover_to_next_decl`

    **Origin:** lane 129's agent, 2026-09-29, reading `check/reserved-words`'s
    applied text while building the `fixes` suite's judgement of cases with no
    `.fixed` (`85066233`, reported and not changed); widened by the
    coordinator on the trunk's compiler at `ee1b648b` to every declaration
    keyword a swap names (`const.hero`, `const_typed.hero`, `fn_brace.hero`,
    `struct_brace.hero` in
    `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/d133/`, 2026-09-29).
    Beside it and not of it: every foreign word the LEXER refuses is reported
    in the first run (`fn add(a: int, b: int) -> int` costs four, clean after
    `--apply`), and `let`, whose repair is guidance, has no certain swap.
    The cause is read and unrun: the lexer emits the word as an `error` token
    (`state.error_token`), and at a top-level line's head the parser's
    recovery drops the whole declaration, its body included.

    **Why it is a defect.** The same as 130's: a mistake present and
    unreported is a silence where a message is owed, and design.md §4.17 asks
    that a model fix a program in one turn. `const MAX = 5`, `fn main() {`
    and `struct Point {` are the habits of the three languages a model has
    read most.

    **Widened 2026-09-29 by lane 133's agent, after its repair landed at
    `6f3d31d6`**: (i) a certain swap that is wrong where it stands, which
    `--apply` writes into a program still refused: `function fn(` to
    `function function(`, `record struct`, `const x = 5` in a body to
    `constant x = 5`, `fn` or `struct` nested in a body, `enum` in a group, a
    same-line `record P fn`, and `include "stdio.h"` to `use`, whose message
    then points at `stdio.h.hero` (defect 015's class of the byte after a
    word, one position further); (ii) `elif` is not read as `else if` (it
    costs `reserved_word`, `unexpected_block` and `expected_expression`) and
    `switch` not as `match`; (iii) `fn(i64) -> i64` without its parentheses
    is silent until the swap; reproducers `shapes/`, `more/`, `a/*swap*`,
    `final/elif_ok.hero`, `shapes/elif_brace.hero`,
    `shapes/switch_expr.hero`, `more/fntype_noparens.hero` in
    `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-joseph-Temp-heroes-heroes-lang/edfda945-b355-427c-a48e-2113b1040b67/scratchpad/lane-133/`, 2026-09-29.

    **Batch gate 2026-09-30 00:07** (`53a5e0a9`, lanes X3 and X4 beside the trunk's
    129 to 133, X1, X2 and Y): the full net, every suite at 0 failed. The shapes
    still open are the next batch lane's items, found beside the repairs, and
    this item stays open until they are repaired and a batch gate reads them.

- [ ] **134 — two builds at once in one tree fail each other with a false internal error** | on a cold `build/`, six `heroes run p.hero` started together fail five in six, 25 of 30 over five rounds, with `internal error: the runtime did not compile` or `internal error: cannot publish build/tu-<key>/p.o` then `error: clang refused the generated C`, where clang refused nothing; two DIFFERENT programs built together in a fresh tree fail one of the two in 5 rounds of 5 | `selfhost/cli/units.hero` (`tu_object`, `link_objects`) · `selfhost/cli/toolchain.hero` (`runtime_object`, `link`) · `selfhost/cli/produce.hero` (the words)

    **Origin:** lane recovery-b1's agent, 2026-09-30, reading why `canonical`
    went red in its batch gate's parallel pass: six harness processes raced
    to publish one `build/<hash>/main`. Reproduced by the coordinator at
    01:55 in a scratch tree with the trunk's compiler at `1fc77e31`, `p.hero`
    being `function main()` over `    print(1)`.

    **Measured on macOS arm64**, each round from `rm -rf build`, six
    processes started together: `heroes run p.hero`, 25 of 30 exit 2 (24
    `the runtime did not compile` then `error: no runtime object`, one
    `cannot publish build/tu-4dc4140d0e94dae5/p.o` then `clang refused the
    generated C`); the runtime object warm and the program cold, 26 of 30
    (`cannot publish` of `p.o` 25 times, of `library.o` once, each followed
    by `clang refused the generated C`); `p.hero` and `q.hero` together, one
    of the two in every round of five; `heroes build p.hero -o o-<i>`, 15 of
    18; `-o same`, 15 of 18, the published binary running; `build --emit-c`,
    10 of 18.

    **The cause, read and not yet proved by a repair.** Every artifact a
    build publishes is staged under ONE name, `object + ".tmp"` or `binary +
    ".tmp"`, and the translation unit's C is written in place, so two
    processes on one key write one file: the first `rename_over` moves that
    one staged file into place, the second finds its own gone, and a clang
    may read the C while another process truncates it. The words then
    misname it: `produce.hero` answers every failure of the link rounds as
    `clang refused the generated C`.

    **Why it is a defect.** A build that fails because another build of the
    same thing ran beside it is a false failure, and its message sends the
    reader to their program or to clang. Two builds in one tree are
    ordinary: an editor's build on save beside a terminal, `make -j`, a
    script over several programs, and the net's own parallel pass, whose
    rule *a suite red in the parallel pass is re-run alone*
    (`.claude/rules/verification.md`) is this defect's cost paid by hand.
    Defect 057's record says *the one collision left is named rather than
    hidden: two builds compiling the identical TU do share its directory,
    and their clang output is identical too*; they share the staged names
    and the C file as well.

    **Unrun, questions rather than premises**: Windows, where `MoveFileExA`
    over a binary another process is running fails where a POSIX rename
    does not; `heroes test` of one program twice at once; a warm cache's
    replay files (`warnings.txt`, the dependency listings) read by one
    process while a second rewrites them, which would lose a warning from
    every later replay, 057's class.

    **2026-09-30, lane 134, a private file has a name no other process uses,

    **2026-09-30, lane 134, a failure that is not clang's refusal is not

    **2026-09-30, lane 134, the net holds it, six builds of one program

    the width it was given**: repaired at `ad117d2f`, found and gated on the
    Windows box; the net is owed at the lane's close.

    **2026-09-30, lane 134, publish's cases force a failed rename the one way
    every platform refuses**: `b5462c86`, gated by the compiler's own tests
    on this Mac and on the Windows box; the net is owed at the lane's close.

    **2026-09-30, lane 134, an author's -o is published as written, never
    split to name the linker's output**: repaired at `d45de7c6`, gated by its
    cases and the compiler's own tests here and on the Windows box; the net
    is owed at the lane's close.

    **2026-09-30, lane 134, three comments name what the repairs left**:
    `722bc973`, the seed byte-identical across it. The lane's gate follows
    in its closing commit, the net on this Mac, Windows and Linux x86-64.

- [ ] **135 — a `certain` fix chosen from one reading, where another is as likely, writes a program that means something else or is refused anew** | `print("\(n)")` costs `unknown_escape` with the certain fix `\\(`, which checks clean and prints the hole's text where Swift's author meant its value; `True` costs `unknown_name` with the certain rename to the one in-scope name within two edits, `run` or `Value`, which then costs `type_mismatch`; a `,` left out before a mutable argument, `hints: nullptr @res`, costs `misplaced_mutable_marker` with the certain `: ` that writes `nullptr : @res`, refused anew | `selfhost/literals.hero:60` (the escape's fix) · `selfhost/resolve/errors.hero` (`suggest`, `nearest`) · `selfhost/grammar_expr.hero` (`misplaced_mutable_marker`)

    **Origin:** the coordinator's measurement lane, 2026-09-30, the parser
    recovery instrument over 641 programs at `c85bccb8`
    (`scratchpad/instrument/baseline-c85bccb8/`): of 2,630 texts `--apply`
    changed, 17 checked clean and meant something else and 23 carried a code
    the first run did not report. The first three shapes below reproduced by
    the coordinator at 03:48 on the trunk's compiler; the fourth is read from
    the instrument's record and not re-run.

    **Measured.** `interp-swift`: 17 of 25 mutants apply into a program that
    checks clean and prints `\(` and the hole's text, and 6 into one refused
    anew. `python-bool`: 13 of 152 renames of `True` or `False` pick a record, a
    variant or a function (`did you mean run?`, `fix (certain): rename to
    run`, then `expected bool, found (function(str) -> ())`). `missing-comma`:
    3 of 153. And one rename of a one-letter name to the only other one-letter
    name in scope (`p` to `s`), where a line over-indented had taken `p` out of
    scope, which then costs `not_mutable`.

    **The cause, read and not yet proved by a repair.** Each fix encodes one
    reading of the mistake where another is as likely, so it is not certain in
    the sense `.claude/rules/diagnostics-and-goldens.md` gives the word, a fix
    that repairs the defect the diagnostic names, compiling not being the bar.
    `\(` followed by a bracketed expression reads as Swift's interpolation as
    much as a literal backslash; `nearest` counts any one candidate within two
    edits (one below four letters) as certain, and the literals `true` and
    `false` are not among its candidates, so `True`, two edits from `run`,
    renames to it; a name and `@` with no `,` between them
    reads as a missing `,` as much as a misplaced `@`.

    **Why it is a defect.** `check --apply` machine-applies a certain fix, so a
    wrong one is written into the author's program without a reader, and in
    the first shape the result compiles and prints the wrong thing: defect
    120's class (a certain `_ = ` that compiled and printed 100 where 93 was
    meant), and defect 015's (a context-blind certain replacement).

    **Unrun, questions rather than premises**: every other `certain` fix in
    `selfhost/` measured by the same instrument's `--apply` pass beyond these
    96 operators; whether a rename's certainty can ask the candidate's kind
    (a value where a value stands, a type where a type does) at the resolver,
    which does not know types.

    **2026-09-30, lane recovery-b3, an escape the language does not have
    keeps its certain `\\` only where it reads as nothing but a backslash**
    (the instrument's `\(`, and beside it an escape by a character's code, one
    written bare, one in a character literal): repaired at `455940f5`, gated
    by its cases and the compiler's own tests; the net is owed at the batch's
    close.

    **2026-09-30, lane recovery-b3, a rename is certain only where the name's
    own letters allow the one candidate, and `True` is `true`** (the
    instrument's `python-bool`, and `p` renamed to `s`): repaired at
    `4e5ef22e`, gated by its cases and the compiler's own tests; the net is
    owed at the batch's close.

    **2026-09-30, lane recovery-b3, a value then `@` in an argument list reads
    as a named mutable argument only where the value is a bare name, and as a
    `,` left out always** (the instrument's `missing-comma`): repaired at
    `83e77694`, gated by its cases and the compiler's own tests; the net is
    owed at the batch's close.

    **2026-09-30, lane recovery-b3, a record's or a variant's type parameters
    end its head's line, told once at the `<`, and its members are read**
    (lane recovery-b2's report, its first shape): repaired at `042a14a4`,
    gated by its cases and the compiler's own tests; the net is owed at the
    batch's close.

- [ ] **136 — `fmt --in-place` and `check --apply --in-place` destroy the author's source when the write fails** | on a disk nearly full, `heroes fmt prog.hero --in-place` answers `error: cannot write`, exit 2, and leaves `prog.hero` at 0 bytes, the 62,706 bytes the author wrote gone; `heroes check --apply --in-place` leaves the file cut mid-token, 57,344 of the 59,312 bytes it meant to write, ending in `retu` | `selfhost/cli/syntax_cmds.hero:66` · `selfhost/cli/check.hero:110` · `runtime/parts/os.c:635` (`hero_file_write`) · `selfhost/cli/publish.hero` (defect 134's publish by rename)

    **Origin:** lane 134's agent, 2026-09-30, reading the code while it
    enumerated every path a build writes (its report: *`fmt --in-place` and
    `check --apply --in-place` write the author's source in place*, not run).
    Reproduced by the coordinator at 06:55 and 06:56 on the trunk's compiler
    at `e5cc73eb`, and again at 09:08 at `f37ea722`, on a 2 MB HFS+ disk image
    (`hdiutil create -size 2m`), filled with `dd` to 8 KB and 4 KB free.

    **Measured.** A program of 62,706 bytes that `fmt` writes as 80,708
    (`v0=0+0*2` over 3000 lines becomes `v0 = 0 + 0 * 2`): `fmt --in-place`
    exit 2, the file 0 bytes, twice. A program of 50,312 bytes whose 1500
    certain swaps of `fn` for `function` write 59,312: `check --apply
    --in-place` exit 2, the file 57,344 bytes, refused at 4358:5 with
    `unknown_name` for `retu`; the original is in neither.

    **The cause, read and not yet proved by a repair.** `hero_file_write`
    opens the path with `fopen(path, "wb")`, which empties it before a byte is
    written, then writes; when the write fails the old text is already gone and
    the new one is not all there. Both in-place verbs call `write_file` on the
    author's own path.

    **Why it is a defect.** The tool destroys the program it was asked to
    rewrite and says only that it could not write, so an author who reads the
    message and looks at the file finds nothing; a full disk is ordinary (the
    Windows box stood at 99% on this night, `run` reading 45 false failures),
    and a killed process or a lost power mid-write is the same shape. Defect
    134's publish by rename, a private name beside the destination and a
    rename over it, is the shape that leaves the old text whole whenever the
    new one cannot be.

    **Unrun, questions rather than premises**: a kill mid-write; Windows;
    what a rename owes a file's mode, owner and links (a read-only source, a
    symlinked one: a publish by rename replaces the link, not what it points
    at); and the library's own `write_file`, which user programs call and whose
    comment promises *the text, written whole, replacing whatever was there*
    (`selfhost/library_source.hero:220`), with the same truncate-first body:
    whether that promise is kept the same way is a question about the
    library, and a change to what it does is the panel's.
