# M-bootstrap-archive — the third language dies *(closed 2026-08-19)*


`crates/` → `archive/bootstrap-rs/` on 2026-08-19, and the move was the last commit rather than
the first, because five things died with the bootstrap and each needed a
successor first — every one measured against what it replaced: `tests/emission/`
(142 programs, both compilers green on the same bytes), `heroes measure`
(3440 / 3512 / spread 72, identical), `suite_spec.hero` (8 checks, replacing 435
lines in which every check was `cfg(test)`), `heroes mutate` (538 mutants,
byte-identical report), and CI's seed leg. The `#~` invariant's runner needed
nothing — M-harness-port had already carried it — and neither did `doctor`, which
has never asked about cargo.

Panel 086 moved the spec-budget ledger to `docs/measurements/010` and gave it the
agreement check it had never had; `records/citations` was built the same day and
found nine dead citations that predated the archive.

**The one number carried forward**: the compiler's own tests cost 13 s through
the Rust and ~16 minutes through the seed. That is the price of self-hosting, and
it became its own decision — CI runs them at tags, the net on every push.
