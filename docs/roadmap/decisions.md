## Decisions this file records

### `scheduled, no warrant` is not decoration

Part 7's preamble defers everything on its list until the closure list compiles
itself, and **a place in the table is not a warrant**. Measurement 003 rider 3 is
the standing precedent: this file scheduled `outline` and `explain`, and
CLAUDE.md §10's stopping rule refused them.

### Two milestones were asked for and neither was added

Asked 2026-08-12; the table is unchanged and this is why (panels 033 and 034).

**Visibility**: three tiers, and two of them were never visibility questions —
private record fields are an opaque type (§4.9 makes construction impossible from
outside, and §4.20 makes a shim read the field anyway) and private variant cases
are `#[non_exhaustive]`, which Rust deleted in 2014, re-added per type in 2019
and documents as costing exhaustiveness. Both are now **Part 6, permanently**.
The third, `private` on a declaration, is **Part 7 item 14** at a pre-fixed +18;
M-selfhost-probe was assigned to decide it and **did, at its close 2026-08-15: no
blockage, so it stays Part 7** — eleven modules ported, every cross-module read
intended, and the rule's own words (*"a blockage there puts it on the closure
list, a wish does not"*) made the close mechanical.

**Errors**: the Rust shape landed at M-optional-map — `T?` is `Result<T,E>`, `?`
is `?`, `.must()` is `.unwrap()` — and the part Rust has that Heroes does not,
the typed error, stays **Part 8 wart 5** rather than becoming a deferral, because
it loses on §4.12's positive rule as well as on simplicity. What is real
underneath the question is measured: `docs/measurements/004-error-codes.md`,
**25 mutants, 0 caught**, and the answer is a `constant`, not a feature.

### The two books, and one rule that governs both

**They are written in simple, simple language** — the register of the `/where`
skill, which explains this project assuming zero compiler knowledge. The author's
instruction is the reason and it outranks elegance, brevity and completeness: he
will read these to *study* what was built, so a sentence that needs a compiler
course to parse is a sentence to rewrite.

**Both exist in Italian and English, one of CLAUDE.md §11's declared
exceptions** to "everything written is English" (§11 records it). Neither version
is a machine translation of the other; the Italian is the one the author studies
from, so where the two diverge, the Italian is fixed to be clearer rather than
the English to be more faithful. **This said *the one* declared exception until
2026-09-04**, when §11 was corrected and these two dependants were not: the
exceptions are a class — a translation that is itself a deliverable — and the
site's Italian edition, 23 pages measured that day, had been the second one for
seventeen days.

**Both teach with M-program-corpus's programs** — code known to compile, run and
pass its own tests in three configurations, rather than snippets that were true
once.
