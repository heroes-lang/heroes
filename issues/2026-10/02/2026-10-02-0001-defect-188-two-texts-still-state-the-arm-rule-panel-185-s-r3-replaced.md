- [ ] **188 — two texts still state the arm rule panel 185's R3 replaced** | `selfhost/check/lending.hero:108-109` quotes the spec as *An arm that does nothing is a block holding `_ = 0`*, where the spec now reads *An arm that does nothing holds `_ = 0`*; `tests/golden/check/fixedbugs-135-a-discard-that-is-the-line-s-one-reading.hero:8` reasons *`_ = ` on the arm's own line is `declaration_in_arm`*, false since R3 | the two lines · **class: improvement**

    **Origin:** lane arm's report, 2026-10-02; read by the coordinator's file-queue agent on `62d65e48` (2026-10-02, `scratchpad/file-queue/stale-arm-texts/`) and re-read on `6bec7c8c` by the coordinator's re-verification agent (2026-10-02, `scratchpad/file-queue/reverify-6bec7c8c.txt`). design.md §4.7 owes nothing: R3 brought the spec to it.

    **Class: improvement**, 2026-10-02 (`.claude/rules/verification.md` § Bounded discovery): no program moves.
