- [ ] **213 — the Linux image carries no SDL3, so defect 151's SDL3 event runs on this Mac alone** | `run/ffi-a-construction-polls-an-sdl3-event` in the arm64 container: *the package sdl3 is not installed on this machine*, skipped; the CI's Linux jobs and the Windows leg skip it too, by their totals | the `heroes-linux-arm64` image and the CI's install list · defect 151's closed record · **class: improvement**

    **Origin:** the coordinator's closings agent, 2026-10-03, and the author's answer *4a*.

    **Class: improvement**, 2026-10-03 (`.claude/rules/verification.md` § Bounded discovery): coverage of one platform.
